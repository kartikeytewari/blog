Hi, there! I am Kartikey Tewari, a Computer Science engineering student at National Institute of Technology (NIT), Hamirpur pursuing Bachelors of Technology. This summer I did a remote intern as a SDE Engineer at FAH Technologies, Gurgaon. I am a competitive programmer and a web developer. I also like to work on Data Structures and Algorithms, and in the process of publishing a research paper on the same. I like to code, solve Rubik's cube and listen to music. This is a blog where I write about the projects and technologies that I am working on.

I do most of my competitive programming in C and C++. I am also quite familiar with the linux system and Bash shell. For web development I tend to use the MEN (Mongo-Express-Node) stack. I am also familiar with Jekyll themes and Ruby. This website is also made using Jekyll. I manage most of my projects using git and my go to solution for deployment is Heroku and Github-pages. I also have experience in Image processing, Parallel Computing and system encryption. My resume is <a href="/blog/resume.pdf"> here </a>.
