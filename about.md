Hi, there! I am Kartikey Tewari, a computer science engineering student at National Institute of Technology (NIT), Hamirpur pursuing Bachelors of Technology. I am a competitive programmer and a web developer. I also like to work on data structures and algorithms, and in the process of publishing a research paper on the same. I like to code, solve rubik's cube and listen to music. This is a blog where I write about the projects and technologies that I am working on.

I do most of my competitive programming in C and C++. I am also quite familiar with the linux system and bash shell. For web development I tend to use the MEN (Mongo-Express-Node) stack. I am also familiar with Jekyll themes and ruby. This website is also made using Jekyll. I manage most of my projects using git and my go to solution for deployment is heroku and github-pages. I also have experience in Image processing, and system encryption. My resume is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YIkFzXEwZE0SdSh04l_MJC6JnpUjm7gZ/view?usp=sharing"> here </a>.
